algorithms -- analysed process to solving a process
they are concept you use in programming
step by step process in programming
Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe
the upper bound of an algorithm running time or space
requirements in terms of the size of the output'
used to detect and  how fast ur code runs and the memory
it occupies
if the output is constant its gonna be 0(1)
this goes for space and time complexity
and this means the output is not influenced
when it is influenced its gonna be 0(n)
0(n) gives us a linear graph; it increases as the values increases linearly
0(1) occupies only one space in the memory
its output value is only 1 and does not increase
when the output does not depend on the input --0(1)
when it depends on the input just once --0(n)
twice 0(n^2)
3times 0(n^3)
and so on...so big O enables us to check the worst case scenario
best to leave it to single digits but in cases where it gets to a 1000
or more we need big O to resolve
